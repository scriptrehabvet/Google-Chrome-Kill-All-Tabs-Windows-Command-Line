# Command line will kill all Google Chrome tabs, i.e. sessions.
To execute the command line using a custom windows shortcut follow the below steps:
Applies to Windows 10

1. Open a command prompt window. You can get there by typing "cmd" into the Cortana / Search box and then right clicking on Command Prompt and selecting "Run as administrator."
2. Type "explorer shell:AppsFolder" (without quotes) at the command prompt and hit Enter. A window with a list of all your apps appears.
3. Right click on an app and select Create shortcut. It may be easier to find your app if you change the view setting to "detailed list" so you can see all the icons in a single column.
4. Click Yes when asked if you want the shortcut on the desktop. A new shortcut icon appears on your desktop.
5. Right click on the new shortcut icon and select Properties.
6. Enter a key combination in the Shortcut key field. The combination must be CTRL + ALT + a letter / number.
7. Click OK.

Note: Remember not to use the same key combination twice. Also note that some programs use CTRL + ALT + keyboard shortcuts that would also launch if you were in their windows. For example, in Photoshop Elements, CTRL + ALT + I brings up the resize menu.
